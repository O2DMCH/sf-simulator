  <div mat-dialog-content>
    <p>
      SF Simulator is a tool for simulating/forecasting base<br />
      stat and experience gains in a customizable way.<br />
      Most of the gains are calculated via known formulas.<br />
      Quest and item generator is randomized hence values<br />
      can be offset by a margin.<br />
      <br />
      Simulator <strong>does not</strong> include:<br />
      - Dungeons' Experience<br />
      - Legendary Dungeon / Hellevator Gold<br />
      - Gold from pet fruits (potion selling)<br />
      - Additional events (basic event cycle is implemented)<br />
      <br />
      Note that simulation below level 300 are very unrealiable<br />
      (base stat cost currently starts at 10mln)<br />
